## Description
This is an application designed to preview and convert **Telltale textures** (files with the **.d3dtx** extension) to more accessible formats like **PNG**, **JPEG**, **DDS**, **TGA**, **HDR**, **TIFF**, **BMP** and vice versa.

## Main Features
- Supports converting `D3DTX` files to more common formats like `PNG`, `JPEG`, `DDS`, `TGA`, `HDR`, `BMP`, `TIFF` and vice versa.
- Supports most, if not all `PC` textures. However, some are not decrypted.
- `PS Vita`, `PS3`, `PS4`, `Nintendo Switch`, `Xbox 360`, `iOS` and `Android` platforms for newer games.
- Supports `2D`, `2D array`, `cubemap` and `volumemap` textures.
- Mip generation, normal map tools, automatic compression and platform swizzling/deswizzling (works for all file types).
- Batch conversion.
- A texture previewer with pan and zoom, and sliders for mips and faces.
- A file explorer with navigation and additional functions.
- Cross-platform support.

## Developers

*Only for modders/developers who plan on forking/modifying/downloading the project.*

There are 3 projects in this repository:
- **TelltaleTextureTool** is the currently-maintained application with a GUI built with **Avalonia UI**. It has the latest features and improvements.

The other 2 projects are located in the Archive folder.
- **D3DTX_TextureConverter** is an older CLI app version of the tool, which is not recommended to use. It can be still used for some of the latest Telltale games.
- **TextureMod_GUI** is the original GUI application built with **WPF (Mahapps)**. It is not recommended to use as it's extremely outdated.

We utilize [`Hexa.NET.DirectXTex`](https://github.com/HexaEngine/Hexa.NET.DirectXTex), a .NET wrapper of [`DirectXTex`](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex), allowing us to work better with texture files.

v2.5.0 will not have a CLI version, while v2.4.0 does support it.

**If you want to learn about the `D3DTX` file format** we suggest you looking [here](https://github.com/iMrShadow/Telltale-Texture-Tool/tree/main/TelltaleTextureTool/TelltaleTextureTool/Telltale/FileTypes/D3DTX/Versions). The classes there are well documented and describe the D3DTX format. Preferably, start with D3DTX_V9.cs and go upwards. There is also [the official documentation](/Docs/home.md).
**Direct Surface Draw (.dds)** is a Microsoft file format, which is described in detail [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddds/dx-graphics-dds).

## Credits
- Thanks to [Ivan Panayotov](https://github.com/iMrShadow) for creating the new GUI and its features, adding support for possibly all games, which include mobile and console platforms, and creating the new documentation.
- Thanks to [David Matos](https://github.com/frostbone25) for his original work on the old converter and its wikipedia. 
- Thanks to [Mawrak](https://github.com/Mawrak) for their work on the original GUI application and its wiki, testing the software and providing critical feedback.
- Thanks to [Lucas Saragosa](https://github.com/LucasSaragosa) for figuring out the Telltale formats and for his help for parsing the `D3DTX` correctly for all supported games. His [TelltaleToolLib](https://github.com/LucasSaragosa/TelltaleToolLib) project served as a reference, which had a lot of influence in the conversion process.
- Thanks to [Knollad Knolladious](https://github.com/LBPHaxMods) for his outstanding feedback, research and knowledge. His discoveries from **Minecraft: Story mode** series led to support other texture layouts, console and mobile platforms, as well as many other things.
- Thanks to [Arrizble](https://www.youtube.com/@arizzble2005) for creating a tutorial, testing the software on **Minecraft: Story mode** series and providing critical feedback.
- Thanks to [Juna Meinhold](https://github.com/JunaMeinhold) for their cross-platform DirectXTex wrapper.
- Thanks to the [DirectXTexNet's](https://github.com/deng0/DirectXTexNet) authors for providing an amazing stable and reliable wrapper.
- Thanks to [Chuck Walbourn](https://github.com/walbourn) for DirectXTex and adding support for obsolete Direct3D9 formats, which are used by older Telltale games.
- Thanks to [SVG Repo](https://www.svgrepo.com/) for their amazing GUI icons.

#### Current Developer Note
*Special thanks to David for introducing me to the Telltale Modding Community and modding as a whole, and for being a good mentor along the way.
Special thanks to Lucas for helping me add support for older games and made me understand the Telltale Tool Engine better.*
